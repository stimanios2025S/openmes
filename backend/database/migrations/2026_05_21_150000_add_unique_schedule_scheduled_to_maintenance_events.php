        // application layer (GenerateMaintenanceEvents::run() checks `exists()`
        // before insert). The DB-level unique constraint added below is a
        // defence-in-depth measure that protects against:
        //   - concurrent workers winning the exists() check in lock-step,
        //   - manual SQL inserts that bypass the service layer,
        //   - future refactors that drop the application-level guard.
        //
        // We use a regular composite unique constraint here. NULL semantics in
        // SQL allow multiple rows with schedule_id IS NULL (NULL != NULL), which
        // is exactly what we want — manually created maintenance events without
        // a parent schedule should not be constrained.
        //
        // Dedup any pre-existing duplicates first so the constraint can be added
        // cleanly. This is defensive — on a freshly migrated database there will
        // be no duplicates, but the statement is cheap and guarantees the
        // migration succeeds on production data that may have slipped through
        // before the application-level guard was added.
        // NOTE: select the aggregate under an explicit `id` alias and pluck by
        // that alias. `pluck(DB::raw('MIN(id)'))` looks up a property literally
        // named "MIN(id)" on each row — SQLite happens to name the output column
        // that way, but Postgres names it "min", so the lookup returns null and
        // the dedup below silently deletes nothing (then the unique index fails).
