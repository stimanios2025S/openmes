/**
 * Deletes uploads the importer no longer has any use for.
 *
 * A file is written as soon as one is picked (Admin → Import), and only the
 * job that imports it deletes it. Everything else leaves it behind: a user who
 * uploads, sees the preview and navigates away, a validation run that is never
 * followed by a real one, a session token that expires. Nothing else ever looks
 * at storage/app/imports, so those files accumulate until the disk notices.
 *
 * A file is kept while any run still needs it: PENDING or PROCESSING (the job
 * has not read it yet), or a finished dry run recent enough that the user may
 * still press "Run the import".
