/**
 * Physical pallet movement history (#103) — who moved which pallet where.
 *
 * Recent window only. The pallet_movements ledger is append-only and grows
 * without bound, so live-syncing the whole table (and preloading a lookup
 * label for every pallet ever moved) would eventually bloat the payload and
 * exhaust memory. Older movements are historical and don't need to live-sync;
 * a dedicated audit report can cover the full trail if ever needed.
 *
 * Electric WHERE clauses can't contain SQL value functions like `now()`, so we
 * embed a literal date computed in PHP at request time. Crossing midnight means
 * the next page load gets a different shape handle (handled by the client
 * automatically); already-open lists keep their shape until they refresh.
