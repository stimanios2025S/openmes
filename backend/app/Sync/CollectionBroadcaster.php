 *
 * One place to see "model → collection(s)", instead of a trait on every model.
 * Booted from AppServiceProvider::boot(). Mirrors the read-side definitions in
 * ShapeRegistry (table/columns/where).
 *
 * Op semantics: "upsert" (client inserts or updates by key) or "delete". For a
 * filtered collection, a row that no longer matches its filter is broadcast as a
 * delete (it left the set) — e.g. a work order going terminal leaves
 * work_orders_active.
