/**
 * The demo dataset behind the shift monitor.
 *
 * Regression guard: the seeder used to hand every station the whole plant's
 * shift roster rather than its own line's, so a fortnight of history became
 * hundreds of windows per station. The batch number packed that window index
 * into a 1000-wide bucket, which then overflowed into the next station's —
 * station 3 window 121 and station 4 window 21 both produced 13210 — and the
 * run died on batches_work_order_id_batch_number_unique with the monitor only
 * half populated.
