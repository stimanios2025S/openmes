/**
 * Operator production rate per machine - how fast a given worker performs on a
 * given workstation, in units/hour.
 *
 * Derived live from existing production events (no dedicated table): every
 * completed batch step records who ran it (completed_by_id), on which machine
 * (workstation_id) and for how long (duration_minutes). A batch flows through
 * each of its steps, so a step "processes" the batch's produced quantity. The
 * rate for an (operator, workstation) pair is therefore:
 *
 *     units/hour = Σ(batch.produced_qty over the pair's steps)
 *                  ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *                  Σ(step duration_minutes for the pair) / 60
 *
 * Because it reads the live step/batch data, the metric reflects new production
 * the moment a step completes - there is nothing to recompute.
