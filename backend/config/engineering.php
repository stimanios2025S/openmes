     | could not act against `/api/*`. `default-src 'none'` blocks external
     | loads/exfiltration; frame-ancestors is appended with the app origin so
     | only the MES app may embed it.
     |
     | `sandbox allow-scripts` (no allow-same-origin) forces the package into an
     | OPAQUE origin at the CSP level too, so it holds even if the response is
     | opened as a top-level document (a leaked signed URL), not just inside the
     | sandboxed <iframe>. Scripts still load because the source directives name
     | the explicit host, which matches regardless of the opaque document origin.
