 *
 * Three raw sources feed it and none of them is shaped like the screen:
 *
 *  - `workstation_states` — a sparse timeline of state slices. Clipped to the
 *    shift, split at hour boundaries, and (for RUNNING) subdivided against the
 *    counter feed so a slice that produced below its nameplate rate reads as a
 *    speed loss rather than as healthy running.
 *  - `machine_events` counters — irregular pulses, bucketed to minutes for the
 *    hourly totals and to 2-minute samples for the rate chart.
 *  - `production_downtimes` — the stops, carrying the cause a supervisor
 *    assigned (or the `needs_reason` flag saying nobody has yet).
 *
 * Everything is derived per request. Nothing here writes.
