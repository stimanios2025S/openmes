/**
 * Modal — Geist White system (design ref: OpenMES Components.dc.html §09
 * form-modal specimen).
 *
 * Form-modal shell: header (15px semibold title + optional mono 9.5px
 * subtitle, × close, line2 hairline), body (children), footer (right-aligned
 * actions, top hairline, panel bg) over the scrim token.
 *
 * `side` turns the same shell into an edge drawer — the panel is full height,
 * flush to one edge, and slides in. Nothing else about it changes: the header,
 * the scrollable body, the footer, the focus trap and `keepMounted` all behave
 * as they do in the centered form.
 *
 * API is identical to the native twin (index.native.tsx).
