     * Make-or-buy on the item master (#—, multi-level BOMs).

     * component from an internally manufactured subassembly is a property of
     * the item itself, not of the line. Flagging it here means `bom_items`
     * keeps its existing shape — every single-level BOM and API client carries
     * on working untouched — while a manufactured material can be exploded one
     * level further through the template that produces it.
     *
     * It also lines up with the existing batch → material-lot link
     * (`material_lots.source_batch_id`): a manufactured material is exactly the
     * kind of item a batch produces and a parent order later consumes, so
     * stock, lots, allocation and genealogy all keep working as they are.
