// OpenMES no longer uses a service worker — the app is online-only (no offline
// mode) and live data streams in over the Reverb WebSocket, so the old
// offline-precache SW
// was removed. This file is intentionally a self-destruct kill-switch: any
// browser still running the previous service worker will, on its next update
// check, install this version, delete all caches, unregister itself, and reload
// open tabs — clearing the stale cache that could otherwise intercept/hang
// requests. Safe to delete this file once no clients hold the old SW.
