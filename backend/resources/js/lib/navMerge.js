/**
 * Where a module's menu contributions land in the sidebar.
 *
 * A module declares a position rather than being appended blindly, so an
 * extension can sit where it belongs — workforce screens next to Admin, a
 * reporting add-on beside Analytics — instead of always trailing behind
 * Settings.
 *
 * The scale is the group `order` in adminNav.js. Built-in groups occupy 10–120
 * in steps of 10, which leaves room between every pair:
 *
 *    10 Connectivity   50 Analytics      90 Webhooks
 *    20 Orders         70 Maintenance   100 Admin
 *    30 Production     80 Inspections   110 Modules
 *    40 Warehouses                      120 Settings
 *
 * A module picks any number: 45 sits between Warehouses and Analytics, 105
 * between Admin and Modules. Omitting it means DEFAULT_MODULE_ORDER — after
 * everything built in, which is the right default for a module whose author has
 * no opinion.
 *
 * Ties keep their relative order (built-in before module, then registration
 * order), so a module cannot displace a core group by matching its number.
 *
 * Plain JS and dependency-free on purpose: the ordering is the part worth
 * testing, and AppLayout cannot be imported in a test.
