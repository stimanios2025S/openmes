## Extensibility & Modules

OpenMES is built to be extended! Use our comprehensive **hook system** to add custom functionality without modifying core code.

A module drops into `backend/modules/`, is toggled in **Admin → Modules**, and
plugs into three kinds of extension point — with **zero runtime cost when
disabled**:

### Hook System

- **Domain events** — react to production activity:
  - Work orders — `WorkOrderCreated`, `WorkOrderUpdated`, `WorkOrderCompleted`
  - Batches & steps — `BatchCreated`, `StepStarted`, `StepCompleted`
  - Machine — `WorkstationStateChanged`, `MachineMessageReceived`
  - Users — `UserAssignedToLine`
  - **`ResourceChanged`** — a generic CRUD hook for **any** curated resource (work orders, customers, materials, lines, …) on create/update/delete
  - **`WorkOrderScheduled`** — a work order is placed/moved on the planner
- **Menu hooks** (`MenuRegistry`) — add links and dropdowns to the sidebar
- **Dashboard widget hooks** (`WidgetRegistry`) — add cards to the admin dashboard

### Create Custom Modules

```php
// In your module's ServiceProvider::boot()
use App\Events\WorkOrder\WorkOrderCompleted;
use App\Services\MenuRegistry;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;

// React to an order completing (observe — never mutate core state here)
Event::listen(WorkOrderCompleted::class, function ($event) {
    ExternalErp::notifyCompletion($event->workOrder);
});

// Add a link to the sidebar
app(MenuRegistry::class)->addItem('production', 'My Page', url('/modules/mine'));
```

### Example Use Cases

- **ERP Integration** - Sync with SAP, Odoo, or custom systems
- **Custom Notifications** - Email, SMS, Slack, Teams
- **Quality Control** - Automated inspections and checks
- **IoT Integration** - Connect machines and sensors
- **Custom Reports** - Generate PDFs, Excel, or API exports
- **Inventory Management** - Auto-update stock levels
- **Barcode/RFID** - Track materials and products

🛠️ **Build a module (step-by-step tutorial)**: [backend/modules/README.md](backend/modules/README.md) — from an empty folder to a running module, plus a code map of how it all works
📚 **Hook reference**: [HOOKS.md](HOOKS.md) — every event, menu and widget hook, with payloads and examples
📁 **Reference Modules**: [`backend/modules/ExampleShowcase`](backend/modules/ExampleShowcase) (all hooks) · [`backend/modules/ExampleHooks`](backend/modules/ExampleHooks) (minimal)

---

## 📦 Built-in Modules

OpenMES ships with optional modules that can be enabled from **Admin → Modules**.

### Packaging — EAN Barcode Scanning Station

Dedicated station for scanning finished products with a barcode reader (EAN/QR) before shipping or warehouse handoff.

**How it works:**

1. Operator opens `/packaging/station` on a dedicated workstation or tablet
2. Scans an EAN barcode with a USB/Bluetooth reader (or types it manually)
3. The system looks up which work order the EAN belongs to and increments its `packed_qty` counter
4. Live stats update every 3 seconds: packed today, plan, backlog, realisation %

**Features:**

- **EAN management** — assign one or multiple EAN codes to any work order (`Admin → Packaging → EAN Codes`)
- **Scan history** — every scan is logged with timestamp, user, and result (success / unknown EAN / error)
- **Shift-based counters** — `packed_qty` resets each shift; shift boundaries are configurable
- **Manual reset** — `php artisan packaging:reset-shift` resets all counters immediately
- **Admin dashboard** — read-only overview of all lines with the same live stats as the operator view

**Routes:**

| URL | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/packaging/station` | Operator, Supervisor, Admin | Scanning station |
| `/packaging/` | Supervisor, Admin | Admin overview |
| `/packaging/eans` | Supervisor, Admin | EAN code management |

**Required migrations** (run automatically on first deploy):

```
create_work_order_eans_table
create_packaging_scan_logs_table
add_packed_qty_to_work_orders_table
```

## Architecture

OpenMES uses a **dead-simple** Laravel monolith architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Laravel App    │  :80 (serves everything)
│  (Blade + API)  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼─────┐
    │ PostgreSQL│
    └──────────┘
```

**Stack:**
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 with Blade templates
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS 4 + Alpine.js for interactivity
- **Real-time**: Livewire 4 for dynamic components
- **Charts**: Chart.js for analytics
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17+ with immutable audit logs
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (2 containers only!)

### Why This Architecture?

- **Ultra Simple**: Just 2 containers (Laravel + PostgreSQL)
- **One-Command Install**: clone, run installer, done
- **No Reverse Proxy**: Laravel serves directly on port 80
- **Easy Maintenance**: Single codebase, traditional Laravel patterns
- **LAN Optimized**: Server-rendered pages, perfect for local networks
- **Mobile Ready**: Responsive Blade templates work on tablets
- **Fast**: Built-in assets compilation with Vite

### ISA-95 Compatibility

OpenMES architecture maps onto the ISA-95 / IEC 62264 standard for Manufacturing Operations Management at Level 3. See [docs/isa95.md](./docs/isa95.md) for the full coverage matrix across Production, Maintenance, Quality, and Inventory operations.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose (20.10+)
- Git

### Installation 🎯

**One command — clone and run the installer:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mes-Open/OpenMes.git
cd OpenMes
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` generates secure credentials into `.env`, **auto-selects a free host port** (80 if it's available, otherwise the next free one — e.g. 8080), builds the app from the cloned source, and starts it in **production**. When it finishes it prints your URL and admin login. Use `./install.sh --yes` to accept all defaults non-interactively.

**Windows?** In **PowerShell** (Docker Desktop) run the equivalent installer — same behaviour as `install.sh`:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

(Under WSL2 just use `./install.sh`.)

**Prefer plain Compose?** `docker compose up -d --build` also works — it builds from source and serves on port 80 (override with `HTTP_PORT`/`HTTPS_PORT` in `.env` if 80 is taken).

### First boot

With Docker, the database is migrated and the admin account is created
automatically on first boot (from the credentials in `.env`) — no manual wizard
step is needed. Open the URL the installer printed and log in.

> Running OpenMES outside Docker (bare PHP)? A web-based setup wizard guides you
> through database and admin configuration the first time you open the site.

### First Steps After Installation

1. **Login** with your admin credentials
2. **Create production lines** in the admin panel
3. **Add users** (operators, supervisors) and assign them to lines
4. **Import work orders** via CSV or create manually
5. **Install PWA on tablets** for offline support

### Troubleshooting

**Containers not starting?**
```bash
# Check container logs
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs postgres

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild containers (if needed)
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

**Database connection errors?**
```bash
# Make sure postgres is healthy
docker-compose ps

# Check database credentials
grep DB_PASSWORD .env backend/.env

# Restart backend
docker-compose restart backend
```

**Application not loading?**
```bash
# Check if services are running
docker-compose ps

# View backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Rebuild backend (includes asset build)
docker-compose build --no-cache backend
docker-compose up -d
```

**Port 80 already in use?**
```bash
# Check what's using port 80
sudo lsof -i :80

# Edit docker-compose.yml to use different port:
# Change: - "80:8000" to "8080:8000"
# Then access at: http://localhost:8080
```

## 📡 Usage reporting

OpenMES reports on **itself** once a day — versions, which features are switched
on, rough size bands, and where errors occur (class, file and line). It never
sends anything you entered into OpenMES: no material or product codes, no lot
numbers, no order data, no recipes, no personal data, and no error message text.
That boundary is [enforced by tests](backend/tests/Feature/Telemetry/), not by
good intentions.

It is on by default. Switch it off in **Settings → System → Usage reporting**,
or set `OPENMES_TELEMETRY=false` before first start. An installation with no
route to the internet behaves exactly like a connected one — nothing breaks,
nothing slows down, and the log does not fill up.

See what would be sent, at any time, with `php artisan telemetry:send --dry-run`.

## Working on the React frontend

OpenMES is incrementally adopting **React via [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/)** alongside the existing Blade + Livewire UI. Both render trees coexist — new pages can opt into React without touching anything else.

### Live-edit workflow (no local Node install required)

The point of this setup: pull the repo, drop it on a server (FTP/SSH/whatever), edit `.jsx` files in place, refresh the browser. No `npm install` on your laptop, no build step in your hands. A container handles it.

Start the stack with the dev overlay:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

That overlay (`docker-compose.dev.yml`):

- Spins up a `frontend` container running `vite build --watch`. It watches `backend/resources/` and rebuilds `backend/public/build/` in ~100ms whenever you save a file.
- Bind-mounts the application source (`app/`, `routes/`, `resources/`, `public/`, …) into the backend container so PHP/Blade edits are live too.

Workflow:

1. Edit `backend/resources/js/Pages/Foo.jsx` (or any source file).
2. The watcher rebuilds automatically — check `docker compose logs -f frontend` if you want to see it.
3. Refresh the browser.

### Adding a new React page

1. Create the page component at `backend/resources/js/Pages/Foo.jsx`:

   ```jsx
   import { Head } from '@inertiajs/react';

   export default function Foo({ greeting }) {
       return (
           <>
               <Head title="Foo" />
               <h1>{greeting}</h1>
           </>
       );
   }
   ```

2. Add a route in `backend/routes/web.php`:

   ```php
   Route::get('/foo', fn () => Inertia::render('Foo', [
       'greeting' => 'Hello from Laravel',
   ]));
   ```

3. Visit `/foo`. Props from the controller arrive as React props.

### Production builds

Production deployments do not use `docker-compose.dev.yml`. The image's `Dockerfile` already runs `npm ci && npm run build` at image build time, so the production container ships with pre-built assets — no Node process at runtime.

---

## Live data sync (Reverb + TanStack DB)

OpenMES live-syncs read data from Laravel to React/mobile clients over a single
WebSocket. Clients **subscribe to a named collection** (a server-defined query)
rather than querying tables directly: they load one snapshot over HTTP, then
receive deltas as they happen. Writes still go through Laravel controllers as
before.

### Architecture — snapshot, then deltas

```
1. snapshot:  client ─► GET /api/collections/{name}  (CollectionController, authed + tenant-scoped)
                        ◄─ { rows: [...], at: <unix ts> }

2. deltas:    Laravel ─► CollectionChanged ─► Reverb ─► private channel col.{tenant}.{collection}
                        ◄─ insert / update / delete, applied by the client's collection adapter

   writes:    client ─► Laravel controllers (validation, auth, Eloquent events) ─► Postgres
```

- **Laravel** owns the collection registry (`app/Sync/ShapeRegistry.php` +
  `app/Sync/Shapes/`): each entry pins a table, a column allowlist and an
  optional server-built `where`. Clients request collections by name, never by
  table. `CollectionController` serves the snapshot; `App\Events\CollectionChanged`
  broadcasts each row change.
- **Reverb** runs as a sidecar container speaking the Pusher protocol. Channels
  are private and namespaced per tenant (`col.{tenantKey}.{collection}`), authorized
  in `routes/channels.php` via the session cookie at `/broadcasting/auth`.
- **Caddy** proxies `/app/*` to Reverb. One multiplexed WebSocket carries every
  collection channel, so the browser's ~6-connection HTTP/1.1 cap doesn't apply
  and no PHP worker is ever held open.
- **Clients** use `lib/echo.js` (one app-wide `laravel-echo` connection) and
  `lib/realtimeCollection.js`, which feeds a TanStack DB collection.

### Adding a new collection

Two files:

1. **Define the shape.** `backend/app/Sync/Shapes/MyShape.php`:

   ```php
   class MyShape extends Shape {
       public function table(): string { return 'my_table'; }
       public function columns(): array { return ['id', 'name', 'status']; }
       public function where(User $user): ?string {
           return "tenant_id = {$user->tenant_id}";
       }
   }
   ```

   Simple lookup tables can skip the class and use an inline
   `['table', 'columns', 'where'?]` config instead.

2. **Register it.** Add to the `$shapes` map in `backend/app/Sync/ShapeRegistry.php`:

   ```php
   'my_collection_name' => MyShape::class,
   ```

Then subscribe from React — the hooks in `lib/useSyncedShape.js` handle the
snapshot and the channel for you:

```jsx
const { data, isLoading } = useSyncedShape('my_collection_name');
```

`useLiveShape` is the same function under a different name (call-site intent
only). Hot app-wide collections are shared via `LiveShapesProvider` — don't
subscribe to them again per page.

### Security model

- Clients **cannot pick the table** — they pick a collection name. Adding a new
  collection is a deliberate code change.
- Clients **cannot pick which columns** to read — the shape's `columns()` method
  is the whitelist. Sensitive columns (password hashes, tokens, PII) simply
  aren't listed.
- Clients **cannot escape the server WHERE** — both the snapshot and the delta
  projection are built server-side from the registry entry.
- Both halves are authorized: the snapshot endpoint requires auth and applies the
  tenant scope, and the delta channel is private, so a user only receives their
  own tenant's rows (plus global `"g"` collections).

### Operational notes

- **App-server runtime.** The backend serves via **Laravel Octane on RoadRunner**
  (`octane:start` is the Dockerfile `CMD`) — a concurrent, in-memory runtime. The
  old `php artisan serve` was single-threaded and serialized every request; it
  remains only as a documented dev fallback. Octane keeps the framework booted
  between requests, so watch for state that assumes a fresh boot per request
  (singletons, static props) — validate the full app under Octane before a
  production rollout.
- **Broadcasting is synchronous.** `CollectionChanged` implements
  `ShouldBroadcastNow` because `QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`; a write's broadcast
  happens inline with the request. Moving to a real queue driver would make
  delivery async — check the latency assumptions in the UI before doing so.
- **Widget registry regression.** The Blade dashboard supported a `WidgetRegistry`
  extension API where modules registered Blade views into named zones
  (`admin_dashboard.kpi`, `admin_dashboard.main`, `admin_dashboard.sidebar`). The
  React dashboard does **not** render these. No bundled module currently uses the
  registry, so nothing actively breaks — but a future React-based widget extension
  API needs to be designed before third-party modules can extend the new dashboard.
