/**
 * Create and edit from the list page, in a right-edge drawer.
 *
 * The list keeps its search, filters, paging and scroll while you fill the
 * form, and the saved row live-syncs back into the table underneath — no
 * navigation, so nothing about the page you were looking at is lost. The
 * standalone `/create` and `/{id}/edit` routes stay exactly as they are; this is
 * a second door onto the same controller actions, not a replacement for them.
 *
 * Three pieces have to line up:
 *   - the page pairs `useResourceDrawer()` with `ResourceTable`'s `onCreate`
 *     and an `onClick` Edit row action,
 *   - the controller uses the `StaysOnList` concern, so the `stay` flag posted
 *     from here is answered with `back()` instead of a redirect,
 *   - `index()` serves the form's option lists (see `ensure` below).
 *
 * Editing reads the record straight out of the synced row the table already
 * holds, so the drawer opens filled in with no round-trip. Where a form needs
 * something the collection doesn't carry — a pivot like `line_ids`, or a secret
 * that must never be broadcast — the page fetches that itself and merges it in
 * through `initial`.
 *
 * One thing the synced row does not give you for free: JSON columns arrive as
 * strings, because the collection snapshot is a `DB::table()` query with no
 * Eloquent casts behind it. `custom_fields` is handled here for every resource;
 * a form binding any *other* json column has to parse it in its own `initial`.
