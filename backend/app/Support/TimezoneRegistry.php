 * floor actually worked.
 *
 * Why the database and not `APP_TIMEZONE`
 * ---------------------------------------
 * A real environment variable always beats the `.env` file: Laravel bootstraps
 * Dotenv against `Env::getRepository()`, which does not overwrite variables that
 * already exist in the process. `docker-compose.yml` sets `APP_TIMEZONE` on every
 * service (defaulting to UTC), so on a Docker install — the deployment the
 * implementation runbook describes — a value written into `.env` is read and then
 * silently ignored. Storing the choice here is what makes it settable from the
 * installer and, later, changeable without editing compose files or restarting.
 *
 * `APP_TIMEZONE` still works and is still respected: it is the fallback whenever
 * this setting is absent, so existing installs and bare-metal deployments keep
 * behaving exactly as before.
